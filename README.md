# A demo "challenge" project to implement A* pathfinding algorithm in C++, create a GUI with SDL2.

## Consulted ChatGPT for a short but difficult assignment. 

**Pathfinding Algorithm Implementation**</br>
*Implement a pathfinding algorithm, such as A-star, which is widely used in games for navigating characters or objects through a game world.*</br>
*Key Features:* </br>
    *Grid-based Map: Create a simple map representation.*</br>
    *A-star Algorithm: Implement the A-star algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.*</br>
    *Visualization: Provide a visual representation of the pathfinding process.*</br>

Status at beginning; I don't have C++ in Visual Studio installed, only gcc in VsCode. I can't remember when I last coded a full C++ program. I only heard of SDL today, it sounds more interesting to me personally than doing something with an engine such as Unity or Unreal.

Project active working time from design to completion 7Â½h. Demo is working, not polished. No prior experience working with A-star or SDL2.

A-star pathfinding algorithm code was readily available at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/ , necessary changes were mostly about returning an object instead of printing the route

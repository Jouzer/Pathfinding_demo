# A demo "challenge" project to implement A* pathfinding algorithm in C++, create a GUI with SDL2.

## Consulted ChatGPT for a short but "difficult" assignment. 

**Pathfinding Algorithm Implementation**</br>
*Implement a pathfinding algorithm, such as A-star, which is widely used in games for navigating characters or objects through a game world.*</br>
*Key Features:* </br>
    *Grid-based Map: Create a simple map representation.*</br>
    *A-star Algorithm: Implement the A-star algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.*</br>
    *Visualization: Provide a visual representation of the pathfinding process.*</br>

Status at beginning; I only heard of SDL today, it sounds more interesting to me personally than doing something with an engine such as Unity or Unreal. I have created multiple ASCII grid based games/protos, and one of them had self-made "AI" the enemies trying to chase you, so the challenge is not totally foreign either

Project active working time from design to working 7Â½h. No prior experience working with A-star or SDL2.

Instructions for installing SDL2 libraries in Visual Studio 2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nkKVyt0DsY </br>
A-star pathfinding algorithm code was readily available at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/ , necessary changes were mostly about returning an object instead of printing the route </br>
